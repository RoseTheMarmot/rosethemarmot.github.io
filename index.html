				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hi I'm Rose and I'm a web developer. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, are my friends, and responsive design is my jam.</p>
				<p>I enjoy solving analytical problems. I fell in love with math when I discovered calculus, and not long after became addicted to programing. Before that I did graphic design and fine art. I've been drawing and painting for as long as I can remember, and I got my first design gig when I was 11 years old.</p>
				<p>In June, 2014 I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Science in Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE). That basically means, I studied computer science and engineering, user centered design, user research, graphic design, project management, and information visualization. I also dabbled about in marine biology and mathematics.</p>
				<p>In my non-work time I enjoy hiking and birdwatching. </p>
